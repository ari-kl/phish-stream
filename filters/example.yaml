# This file contains a sample filter configuration
# Please use this as a template/reference for creating your own filters
# Don't forget to enable the filter by setting 'enabled' to 'true'
name: "Example Filter"
enabled: true

# Any domains containing these keywords will be matched
# Note: These will be matched as substrings, so "micro" will still match "microsoft"
keywords:
  - "example"
  - "filter"

# These terms will be checked against Jaro-Winkler similarity
# If the similarity is above the threshold, the domain will be matched
# The domain will be split up into words by separators (e.g. "-") and each word will be checked individually
similarity:
  - threshold: 1
    terms:
      - "example"
      - "filter"
  - threshold: 0.95
    terms:
      - "hello"
      - "world"

# This is a list of regex patterns that will be checked against the domain
regex:
  - "example[0-9]+"

# This is a list of keywords that will automatically skip the domain for this filter
# These will be matched as substrings, same as the 'keywords' field
exclusions:
  - "exomple"
