# phish-stream

This is a program that filters through domains gathered by [Certstream](https://certstream.calidog.io/) to match pre-defined conditions. Matches domains are then sent to a slack channel for manual classification.

## Setup

The following environment variables are required to be set in order to run the program:
- `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`: The token for the slack app (starts with `xapp-`)
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: The token for the slack bot (starts with `xoxb-`) â€” socket mode must be enabled
- `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`: The slack channel ID to send messages to
- `PHISH_OBSERVER_API_KEY`: The API key for the [Phish Observer](https://phish.observer) API

See `.env.example` for a template.

In your filters directory, create yaml files following the format seen in `filters/example.yaml`. The `name` and `enabled` fields are required, all others are optional.

## Running

To run the program, simply run `./phish-stream` in the root directory of the project.

There are a few optional flags that can be passed to the program:

- `--filters`: The directory containing the filter files. Defaults to `filters/`
- `--loglevel`: Minimum log level to output. Defaults to `info`. Options are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error`.
